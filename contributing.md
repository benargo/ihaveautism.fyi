# Contribution Guide

You can support this project by translating it into multiple languages. The application is based on the [Laravel PHP framework](https://laravel.com) and uses their [Localization](https://laravel.com/docs/master/localization) utility to power translating of sentences.

Static sentences, such as those which power navigation, headings and other fixed text blocks can be found in:

    /resources
        /lang
            /en
                /[static.php](https://github.com/benargo/ihaveautism.fyi/blob/master/resources/lang/en/static.php)

Default sentences, which can be customised by individuals can be found in:

    /resources
        /lang
            /en
                /[defaults.php](https://github.com/benargo/ihaveautism.fyi/blob/master/resources/lang/en/defaults.php)
